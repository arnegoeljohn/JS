          Historically in the Philippines, due to widespread poverty, the
          problem of abandoned, abused, or dangerously neglected (AADN) children
          has been remarkably large. Many hundreds of thousands of children,
          perhaps millions, have grown up living mostly on the streets. There is
          very minimal governmental protection or assistance for what are often
          termed “street children,” and in class-segregated social systems these
          children are not only viewed as a nuisance, but are the target of a
          wide variety of evils.

          The Face the Children (FTC) program is established to serve AADN
          children through a program that provides protection, care, nurture,
          education, and spiritual development that affords them a genuinely
          greater opportunity for a dignified and meaningful adult life.
